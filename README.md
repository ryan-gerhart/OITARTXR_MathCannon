## What is PhysicsEffectsGallery?

The *PhysicsEffectsGallery* project (scene: PhysicsEffectsGallery) demonstrates various examples of physics effects and visual scripting.

In this project, you'll find:

* **Default game physics**: demonstrating shapes, constraints and restitution
* **Explosions**: configured with different parameters (both spherical and directional)
* **Velocity fields**: showing diffent options to move objects 
* **Throwing objects**: with ball or dart like behavior
* **Visual Scripting examples**: for 3D button and slider UI elements
* **Mass and Gravity**: scaled gravity or objects orbiting around the sun
* **Buoyancy**: with objects floating on the waves

Additonally, there are several **unpolished** game mechanics examples:

* **Pinball**, **Bowling**, **Air Hockey**, **Balancing Maze**, **Fishing Game**, **Baseball Cage**, **Mini Golf**, **Cannon Shooting** and the **Toy Cars**.

This is a programmer-art designed scene that demonstrates the power of combining appealing visuals with the creative use of Mesh Physics features. Feel free to inspect, modify and play with the scene or use elements to creatively enhance your own custom experiences!
